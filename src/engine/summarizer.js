  // it fired on every no-text run with byte-identical payloads (the upstream
  // error is deterministic) and flooded the dev-server log. The raw chunk
  // shapes are STILL recorded into `probeBuf`; a targeted probe can be
  // re-enabled via `recordOnEmpty` should a genuinely NEW failure shape ever
  // appear. The persistent `CRASH-HARNESS` line emitted on terminal
  // `kind:'error'` finishes (in `summarize`) now carries the discriminating
  // detail instead.
  // `_chunkCount` is exposed (underscore-prefixed, internal) purely so a
  // missing-finish diagnostic can distinguish "consumed N chunks but never a
  // terminal finish" from "consumed ZERO chunks (silent/lazy/no-op stream)";
  // `_explicitFinish` additionally lets the caller tell a SYNTHESIZED
  // terminator apart from a real terminal finish chunk when rendering its
  // diagnostics.
