/**
 * dsh-force-compact's per-model-request guard — the "hook the core model
 * request" half of the plugin.
 *
 * Instead of (or in addition to) the `session/flush` checkpoint, this guard
 * runs at the official model-request seam so the decision is made **right
 * before a model request is made**:
 *
 * - **`agent/request`** (a Waterfall around the frozen call configuration) —
 *   a deliberate **pass-through** (2026-08 semantics revision): the returned
 *   `LlmCallConfig` rides UNCHANGED. `disableThinking` now scopes strictly to
 *   this plugin's own compaction summarization call (enforced inside
 *   `engine/builtin.js` → `engine/summarizer.js`); all other model requests
 *   retain the machine's own reasoning-effort configuration.
 * - **`agent/pre-step`** (a Waterfall before each model step) — reads the
 *   session's **projected context tokens** through the official
 *   `contextPressure` projection (`projectedTokens` — the exact figure the
 *   harness renders in the bottom-right corner, provider-anchored). When
 *   the reading is **>= `autoThresholdTokens`**, the guard rejects the proposed
 *   step (so the model request is NOT made) and instead retains the **latest
 *   `retainLatestTokens` of the conversation's tokens verbatim** while sending
 *   everything before that cutoff to the `compaction`
 *   service's `compactRegion` (read live via `ctx.get('compaction')`), which
 *   condenses the head history and lets the loop retry with a smaller context.
 *
 * Both settings are read **per request** from the plugin's live Config refs
 * (`readRawSetting`, bound by `apply`), so a settings-form edit is picked up on
 * the next model request without a restart.
 *

/**
 * Compact a session's head so that the latest `retainLatestTokens` of the

 * via the `compaction` service's `compactRegion(start, end, agent, signal)`.
 * Measures the session's total context tokens (via `tokenMeter` or a
 * character-based fallback), then delegates the durable mutation.
 *
 * Selection prefers the meter's own per-node prices (when a `measure()` snapshot
 * is available): starting FROM THE LATEST surface node, ACCUMULATE node tokens
 * BACKWARD until the sum REACHES OR EXCEEDS `retainLatestTokens`; the cutoff
 * splits the surface into the head SPAN TO COMPACT and the RETAINED TAIL
 * (verbatim). Everything before the cut (plus the snap-to-nearest-preceding-
 * tool-pairing-balanced-boundary adjustment — the official pairing ledger,
 * a strict superset of `user/message` boundaries) is sent to the summarizer
 * AS ONE BATCH — the original span's entries become shadowed/skipped in
 * derived history. Before spending the summarization round-trip, the selected
 * span passes TWO official safety gates (both ported from `compaction-basic`):
 * a SURFACE-CONSISTENCY cross-check (the meter's priced snapshot must align
 * node-for-node with the CURRENT `session.surface.nodes`; a concurrent
 * modification between measure and selection aborts this attempt) and the
 * `validateSurfaceRegion` DOUBLE-BALANCE gate (both bounds must sit on
 * tool-pairing balanced cuts — a candidate that would split a step's
 * tool-call/result pair is refused here, logged, and skipped).
 *
 * Legacy `selectEarliestByTokens` is used only when no measurement snapshot is
 * available (tokenMeter absent): it estimates total tokens from char-count and
 * picks a head-aligned prefix under the same `retainLatestTokens` budget (with
 * an implicit total assumption that fits the legacy behavior).
 *
 * Never throws: all failures resolve `false` so the caller's model request
 * proceeds unimpeded.

 * working pairs NON-importantly, and the guard inside `publishUiStatus` REFUSES
 * to overwrite a `[`-prefixed bracket text — so that residue sticks (the "总是

 *
 * Awaited (NOT fire-and-forget) and fully contained: the caller awaits this so the

 * step would publish — otherwise the two important writes race and a working pair
 * could transiently mask a genuine in-progress compaction. `publishUiStatus`
