/**
 * dsh-force-compact settings — the "强制压缩配置" (Force-Compact Configuration)
 * surface.
 *
 * User-tunable parameters are registered under the `falling-ts-force-compact`
 * settings namespace so the harness settings panel can expose and persist them
 * (the `falling-ts-` prefix prevents collisions with other plugins' keys):
 *
 * - `disableThinking` (boolean, default `true`): when true, the plugin's
 *   compaction summarization request carries `reasoningEffort: 'off'`, which
 *   the LLM adapter maps to `thinking: { type: 'disabled' }` — i.e. the
 *   provider's thinking/reasoning is switched off for the summarization call.
 * - `autoThresholdTokens` (positive integer, default `32000`, floor `32000`):
 *   the automatic compaction trigger threshold in tokens. Compaction runs only
 *   when the session's estimated total context is at least this many tokens;
 *   below it, the checkpoint is skipped. Stored values BELOW the floor are
 *   coerced UP to it at read time (and the schema rejects sub-floor drafts).
 * - `retainLatestTokens` (positive integer, default `8000`, floor `8000`): the
 *   ABSOLUTE TOKEN COUNT retained at the LATEST end of the session's surface
 *   when an auto or forced compaction fires. Starting from the newest surface
 *   node and walking BACKWARD (latest → oldest) using the official
 *   `tokenMeter`'s per-node token prices, node tokens accumulate until the
 *   running sum
 *   REACHES OR EXCEEDS this budget; everything before that cutoff forms the
 *   head-anchored region compacted into a single summary node in one LLM call
 *   (the original entries of the compacted span become shadowed / skipped in
 *   derived history). Replaces the former `autoEarliestRatio` /
 *   `forceEarliestRatio` percentage knobs with a fixed retention target
 *   independent of the (possibly usage-inflated) `totalTokens` denominator.
 * - `turnEndForceCompactionEnabled` (boolean, default `true`): whether a turn-end
 *   forced compaction runs when the agent transitions to `idle` — compaction
 *   goes through the engine's idle manual entry (`compactNow`), which uses its
 *   own range selection (the idle path cannot select a custom token fraction,
 *   so there is no turn-end ratio parameter).
 * - `debug` (boolean, default `true`): the gate for the debug log
 *   (`core/log.js`). **On by default** so the plugin's `[force-compact]`
 *   diagnostics always land in the debug file; set `false` for a production
 *   deployment to suppress the file. There is no environment auto-detection —
 *   the operator declares intent directly via this flag.
 * - `logFile` (string, default `~/.dsh/logs/dsh-force-compact.log`): the
 *   debug-log target path. Leading `~` expands to the OS user home, so by
 *   default the log sits under the shared user `$DSH_HOME` (`~/.dsh/logs/`),
 *   independent of any single session's workspace — keeping the log out of the
 *   official `deepseek-harness` checkout. Any absolute path may override it.
 * - `compactionMode` (`'realm'` | `'global'`, default `'realm'`): how the
 *   plugin locates the official `compaction` service (realm-scoped per-agent
 *   vs host-global). See `COMPACT_MODE_*` constants below.
 * - `builtinEnabled` (boolean, default `true`): the gate for this plugin's
 *   own self-contained compaction engine (see `engine/builtin.js`). When
 *   the official `compaction` service is reachable (host-global mount), it is
 *   always preferred; when unreachable (the standard preset realm-isolates it)
 *   the plugin falls back to the builtin engine — which runs the full durable
 *   transaction itself (reusing the OFFICIAL `compaction/*` event vocabulary, own checkpoint
 *   `user/message` shadowing a head-anchored span, own shrink gate). Setting
 *   this to `false` disables that fallback so ONLY the official backend is
 *   attempted.
 * - `maxSummaryTokens` (positive integer, default `1024`, floor `1024`): the
 *   `maxTokens` bound applied to the plugin's OWN summarization LLM call — a
 *   cap on the summary length. Combined with the shrink gate (the summary must
 *   be strictly smaller than the span it replaces), this prevents runaway
 *   summarizer outputs from ballooning past the region being condensed.
 *   Stored values below the floor are coerced up to it at read time.
 * - `summarizationTimeoutMs` (positive integer, default `90000`, floor `5000`):
 *   the hard wall-clock cap for ONE summarization stream in milliseconds
 *   (plugs into `summarizer.js`'s hung-stream guard — see
 *   `SUMMARIZATION_TIMEOUT_MS`). Below-floor values are coerced UP to the floor
 *   at read time (a sub-5s cap would false-positive abort slow local endpoints);
 *   there is NO ceiling — a large value effectively disables the guard.
 *
 * The namespace is registered against the `settings` service when one is
 * mounted. The schema is BUILT BEST-EFFORT through `@deepseek-ai/schemastery`:
 * when that bare module cannot be resolved from the plugin's install location
 * (common when the plugin is developed outside a node_modules root, where Node
 * cannot walk up to find it), {@linkcode buildSchema} returns `null` and
 * {@linkcode registerNamespace} falls back to registering the namespace with
 * **defaults only** (editable fields, no validation metadata) rather than
 * skipping registration entirely — so the settings panel still loads and the
 * values remain readable/writable. A `settings` service absence still results
 * in a no-op, so it is never a hard dependency.
