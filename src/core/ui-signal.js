/**
 * Live UI status messenger — the plugin-private bridge between the HOST half
 * ("which phase am I in right now?") and the CLIENT half ("paint THAT pair on
 * the `TurnStatus` DOM node").
 *
 * Why settings at all
 * ------------------
 * The client half (`web/client.js`) already mirrors the `falling-ts-force-compact`
 * namespace through `settingsScope.bind` → `createSnapshotStore`, so ANY field
 * written by the host here is reflected in the browser live (the `SettingsScope`
 * revision-fencing contract). That is the ONLY sanctioned host→browser live-data
 * channel this independent plugin bundle can use — there is no reverse RPC seam
 * for a client-loaded plugin to expose arbitrary callable methods (the unary
 * route map is closed and host-defined). The `liveUi` field documented below is
 * therefore a PLUGIN-PRIVATE transient messenger: the host is its only writer;
 * the client never writes it; it deliberately persists to `settings.yaml` like
 * every other field of the namespace (harmless cosmetic residue — the worst
 * outcome after a restart is the badge briefly showing a stale phase before the
 * next LLM call overwrites it).
 *
 * Phases
 * ------
 * Every model request begins with a WORKING phase (a random text+color pair
 * drawn from the 20×20 tables below — the "工作中的状态" set). Around a
 * force-compaction the display is OVERRIDDEN deterministically, not randomly:
 *
 *   • COMPRESSING — pinned red `[强制压缩中>>>]`, fired BEFORE the `compactNow` /
 *     `compactRegion` call;
 *   • DONE        — pinned green `[压缩完成!]`, fired right AFTER the call
 *     commits; then after `DONE_FALLBACK_MS` (3 s) a forced
 *     `isImportant=true` push redraws a fresh random Deep working pair
 *     (single-purpose timer — the only one in this module);
 *   • END         — pinned EMPTY text `""`, fired at the END of a
 *     conversation (the `agent/status` idle transition — hooks/idle.js): a
 *     CLEAR push that empties the badge (the client strips the painted text
 *     and phase class, restoring the official appearance). Replaces the
 *     former conversation-START forced working-pair override (removed 2026-09).
 *
 * Every published payload carries BOTH a canonical `text` (the Chinese default)
 * and a locale-independent `textId` discriminator: `'working.N'` (index into
 * {@link WORKING_TEXTS}), or the phase name itself for the pinned phases
 * (`'compressing'` / `'done'` / `'end'`). `textId` is the localization seam:
 * the client half (`web/client.js` `paintTurnStatus`) maps it through its own
 * `ctx.locale` zh/en dictionaries, so the badge follows the app language, and
 * falls back to the canonical `text` when `textId` is absent or unresolvable.
 * The host half must stay locale-agnostic — dsh exposes the locale service
 * only to the client web half, not to the host.
 *
 * All writers are GUARANTEED never to throw (they wrap the settings-service
 * write in try/catch): a messenger failure must NEVER disrupt the model
 * request or the compaction transaction itself.
