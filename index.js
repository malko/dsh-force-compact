/**
 * dsh-force-compact — a DSH Cordis function plugin.
 *
 * Hooks the core model-request seam so the "强制压缩配置" (force-compact)
 * settings are read on **every model request**:
 *
 * - **`agent/request`** (a Waterfall around the frozen call configuration) —
 *   a deliberate **pass-through**: business model requests ride the machine's
 *   `LlmCallConfig` unchanged. The `disableThinking` setting does NOT blanket
 *   business calls (2026-08 semantics revision) — it scopes STRICTLY to the
 *   plugin's own compaction summarization call (`engine/summarizer.js` reads
 *   `settings.disableThinking` and stamps `reasoningEffort: 'off'` on its
 *   `ctx.llm.stream` options; `engine/builtin.js` routes the flag through the
 *   `extra` argument). Reading the settings here on every request means a
 *   `settings.yaml` edit is picked up on the next request regardless of scope.
 * - **`agent/pre-step`** (a Waterfall before each model step) — reads the
 *   session's total context tokens; when they reach the `autoThresholdTokens`
 *   threshold the proposed step is rejected (the model request is NOT made)
 *   and the **latest `retainLatestTokens` of the conversation's tokens** is
 *   RETAINED VERBATIM (everything before that cutoff is compacted in one
 *   batch into a single summary node)
 *   compacted via the `compaction` service's `compactRegion` instead.
 *
 * The plugin also keeps the `session/flush` durability checkpoint: a
 * checkpoint-driven compaction (its own region policy + LLM summarizer,
 * delegated to the `compaction` service's `compactRegion`) so useful history
 * is condensed even between model requests.
 *
 * Layout:
 * - `index.js`         — this file; the Cordis plugin entry (listener registrations).
 * - `core/policy.js`   — fixed compaction-policy knobs (tunables).
 * - `core/settings.js` — the `falling-ts-force-compact` settings namespace (parameters + schema).
 * - `core/log.js`      — the debug-log sink (routes `[force-compact]` lines to `logFile`).
 * - `engine/region.js`     — the plugin's own head-anchored region selection.
 * - `engine/summarizer.js` — the plugin's own one-shot LLM summarizer (preview + shrink gate).
 * - `engine/builtin.js`    — the self-contained compaction engine (official-named `compaction/*` transactions).
 * - `engine/checkpoint.js` — the `session/flush` checkpoint orchestrator: region → delegate to a backend.
 * - `engine/backend.js`    — the unified backend facade (official-service-first, builtin-fallback).
 * - `hooks/guard.js`       — the per-model-request guard: threshold gate + forced compaction (+ legacy `thinkingDisabled` predicate).
 * - `hooks/command.js`     — the `/force-compact` slash command (idle → compact now; busy → queue a force flag).
 * - `hooks/idle.js`        — the turn-end (agent `idle`) forced compaction.
 * - `web/client.js`        — the browser half: the Force-Compact settings.section UI.

/**
 * Per-session COMPRESSION SLOT — one in-flight `compactSession` operation per
 * session id (keyed by `session.id`, value the SETTLING PROMISE of that
 * operation). Process-local, bounded naturally by the number of live sessions —
 * no timer, no persistent state.
 *
 * WHY THE LISTENER MUST BE SYNCHRONOUS (the "third send wedges" root cause):
 * `session/flush` is an AWAITED `parallel` checkpoint — the dispatcher runs every
 * listener via `Promise.allSettled` and proceeds once they ALL settle. One of
 * those listeners is the PERSISTENCE COORDINATOR's own handler, which awaits
 * `live.writes.flush()` — a SHARED write-behind barrier for the session id. If
 * OUR listener `await`s `compactSession` INSIDE the checkpoint (as it used to),
 * we participate in the flush's await path: our compaction's durable appends
 * enqueue onto the coordinator's PER-ID serial `chains` bucket, and when two
 * `sessions.flush` callers overlap on the same id within one event-loop tick
 * (observed live: two flush checkpoints a millisecond apart, the inner firing
 * while the outer was mid-`compactRegion`), the barrier and the per-id queue
 * enter a mutual-wait interleave — the barrier waits on a `serialize` op whose
 * `prior` never settles, so the barrier never resolves, so the outer `sessions.
 * flush` never returns, so the caller's pre-step waterfall never resumes, and
 * EVERY later `session.list` / `history` for that id queues behind the poisoned
 * `prior` forever (event loop alive, CPU idle, specific id permanently stalled).
 *
 * FIX — decouple the compaction FROM the checkpoint's await path:
 * 1. The listener STARTS the compaction but does NOT `await` it; it returns
 *    immediately (synchronously), so we are never on the flush's await path and
 *    cannot hold the barrier open. The `SessionStore.flush` dispatcher sees our
 *    listener settle instantly.
 * 2. A PER-ID SLOT serializes compactions: if a compaction for the same id is
 *    ALREADY running, a repeat `session/flush` dispatch STARTS NOTHING (skip);
 *    the slot clears only when the in-flight op SETTLES, so a following flush
 *    after it completes starts a fresh attempt. No concurrent same-id
 *    `compactRegion` calls, no re-entrant recursion, no barrier interleave.
 *
 * DURABILITY NOTE: the checkpoint still GUARANTEES the compaction was STARTED by
 * the time it fires (started-before-return, not completed-before-return). Ordering
 * with the next flush is preserved because the slot suppresses overlap until
 * settlement. A crash mid-compaction loses the slot (process-local) and relies on
 * the durable `compaction/*` bracket (an unclosed `compaction/start` surfaces as
 * a `busy` assertion on reload — the expected, safe failure mode).
 * @type {Map<string, Promise<void>>}

/**
 * Register the model-request Waterfalls, the `session/flush` listener, and the
 * `falling-ts-force-compact` settings namespace (the "强制压缩配置" surface).
 *
 * `compaction` is a runtime dependency provided by the preset plane
 * (`include:agent-presets:compaction-basic`, enabled and mounted by default).
 * In modern harness compositions it is mounted **per agent realm** (each preset
 * isolates it), so the plugin-GLOBAL `ctx.get('compaction')` is `undefined`
 * while the listener's OWN context — `this` inside an `agent/*` callback, the
 * agent's scoped context — resolves the instance. Every compaction path therefore
 * captures the LISTENER context (`ctx.on(event, function (p, n) { … })` binds
 * `this` to the dispatch context) and locates the service through it, with a
 * host-global fallback (see `engine/backend.js`). Missing-service cases are
 * still guarded (`undefined` → skip with a log), so a gap never blocks a
 * listener. The plugin therefore declares no `inject` — profile entries activate
 * at process boot, before the preset plane mounts the service, and a boot-time
 * `inject` would fail the boot assertion. `agents`, `settings`, `tokenMeter`, and
 * `commands` are likewise optional: each is read with `ctx.get(...)` and guarded
 * against `undefined` (the plugin falls back to its composition defaults, a
 * coarse estimate, or a skipped registration).

/**
 * Plugin entry — the UNIVERSAL-CRASH-NET-covered form of {@link __applyInner}.
 *
 * Every public entry in the plugin is routed through {@link guardFn}: the
 * wrapper catches any throw (sync or promise rejection) crossing this
 * boundary, appends a full diagnostic (function name, thrownAt
 * `file:line:col`, deepest plugin frame, nearest non-plugin frame, full call
 * stack) to the durable crash log, and propagates the original outcome
 * unchanged. `apply` is called ONCE per fiber at boot — the process-wide net
 * ({@link installCrashNet}) is installed from inside the inner body before
 * any listener is registered.
 *
 * `config` is the Loader-resolved plugin Config (schemastery volatile refs) and
 * MUST be forwarded: the Host reads every tunable through those refs, so
 * dropping it would silently pin every setting to `DEFAULTS`.
